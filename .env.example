# ================================================
# ClawRouter Environment Variables
# ================================================
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values.
# Env vars can also be exported in your shell or
# loaded via Node.js 20+ --env-file=.env flag.

# === Free Mode (LiteLLM / self-hosted) ==========
# Bypass x402 payments and route through your own
# OpenAI-compatible API (e.g. LiteLLM proxy).
# All models become free — you pay through your
# own provider keys configured in LiteLLM.

# Set to "true" to enable free mode
# CLAWROUTER_FREE_MODE=true

# Base URL for your OpenAI-compatible API
# Must include the /v1 path segment
# CLAWROUTER_API_BASE=http://localhost:4000/v1

# API key for your LLM provider (sent as Bearer token)
# CLAWROUTER_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key

# === BlockRun Mode (default) =====================
# When free mode is off, ClawRouter uses BlockRun's
# x402 micropayment protocol with USDC on Base L2.

# Ethereum private key for x402 micropayments (0x-prefixed hex)
# If not set, a wallet is auto-generated on first run
# and saved to ~/.openclaw/blockrun/wallet.key
# BLOCKRUN_WALLET_KEY=0x...

# === General Settings ============================

# Port for the local proxy server (default: 8402)
# BLOCKRUN_PROXY_PORT=8402

# Bind host for the proxy (default: 127.0.0.1)
# Set to 0.0.0.0 for Docker / container deployments
# CLAWROUTER_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Enable browser-specific tier selection (vision-capable models for UI tasks)
# When false/unset, browser tasks use standard or agentic tiers instead
# CLAWROUTER_BROWSER_TIERS=true

# Disable ClawRouter entirely (bypasses all routing)
# CLAWROUTER_DISABLED=true
